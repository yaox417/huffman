The real challenge of the project was to use the bare-bone data structures provided in C. The ubiquitous list structure in Racket is actually a linked list in disguise. I realized this when I was trying to build an array of pointers in C. I spent a lot of time writing (and debugging) basic functions that I can do with a one-liner in Racket such as finding the minimum element and removing a element from a linked list.
