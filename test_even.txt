\section{Lessons Learnt}
The program should prompt you to enter one of three choices. Proceed. Note that the program can only deal with ASCII files as of now. 
\item \textbf{Code Validation}\newline
Just because the code compiles does not mean it does what you want it to do. Always write tests with synthetic data. 
\item \textbf{Exploit the strengths of a language} 
Exploit the data structures in different languages - use Racket for easy implementation to solidify understanding, use C for speed and low-level manipulation. Exploit the deterministic nature of Huffman tree when saving the tree.
\item Simple code sometimes has a high price tag (see point 3 for detail).
\item There is nothing more motivating
